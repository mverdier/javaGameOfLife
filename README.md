This is a basic implementation of Cornway's Game of Life.

I've been presented this a few days ago and wanted to try my hand at it. Unfortunately, I'm pretty lame at user interfaces in plain Java, so I ended up just printing it in the console. All in all it's pretty much the same.

I'll finish fixing it up and I'll see how much I can improve it. Maybe I'll end up adding a UI, who knows.
